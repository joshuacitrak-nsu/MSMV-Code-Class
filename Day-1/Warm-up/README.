🧠 Warm-Up Code Puzzles

Welcome back, coders! 👾
These warm-ups are quick puzzles to help you remember the skills we learned last year and get comfortable with GitHub + VSCode.dev again.

Each puzzle should take 2–3 minutes, for a total of about 10–15 minutes.

Before starting, review the four big ideas below — comments, variables, functions, and event listeners.

✅ Comments

Comments are little notes you write inside your code that the computer ignores.
They are meant for humans, not machines.

// This is a comment. It explains what the code does.

Why we use them:

They help you remember what your code does.

They help other people understand your code.

They help AI assistants (like Copilot!) know what you want.

Think of comments like:

🧡 Sticky notes in a book
🧡 Directions written on your LEGO set
🧡 Notes to your future self

✅ Variables

A variable is a box that holds information.

let score = 0;    // put 0 into a box called "score"
score = score + 1;   // update the box with a new value

Why we use them:

To store things your program needs to remember (score, clicks, time).

To make your game change over time.

Think of variables like:

🟦 A bucket with a label
🟦 A save slot in a video game

✅ Functions

A function is a mini-program inside your program.

function addScore() {
  // steps that run when the function is called
}

Why we use them:

They keep code organized.

They prevent repeating the same code everywhere.

They let buttons and events trigger actions.

Think of functions like:

🍳 A recipe
📦 A set of instructions you can use again and again

✅ Event Listeners

Event listeners make your code react to things happening on the page.

button.addEventListener("click", addScore);


This means:

“When someone clicks this button, run the addScore function.”

Why we use them:

They make your project interactive!

Buttons work, games run, animations start, timers tick.

Think of event listeners like:

👀 A referee watching the game
🎮 A controller button being pressed

✅ Your Warm-Up Puzzles

You will find these folders in this repository:

warmups/
  01-comment-to-code
  02-wire-the-button
  03-comment-detective
  04-predict-the-output
  05-bug-hunt


Open each folder, read the instructions in the script.js file,
and complete the tiny challenge.

Pro Tips:

✅ Read the comments first — they tell you exactly what to do.
✅ Use console.log() if you want to peek at what’s happening.
✅ Commit your work after each puzzle.

⭐ After You Finish

Make sure you commit your changes:
